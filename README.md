<h2>Oddwires-Alarm-System</h2>

UPDATE 01/07/2018:<br>
This repo is completely defunct. There have been several updates to the Raspberry Pi Debian image which have killed off the Mail Transfer Agent, and messed up a few other bits and peices in the build.<br>
I've also re-worked the GUI from JQuery Touch to  JQuery Mobile, and added a HomeKit Bridge to provide an additional voice interface.<br>
If you are thinking of trying the install, use the alarm-system Repo, which addresses these issues, and adds additional functionality.
